## This is my new mini-project, Analog & Digital Clock under the series of [Experimantal](https://github.com/P4RT33K/Experimental)
### I made this using HTML5, CSS3 & Vanilla JS.

This project takes inspiration from a YouTube video, which is under same title.

Here's the [link](https://p4rt33k.github.io/Analog_and_Digital_Clock/home.html) to it!
